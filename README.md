## Explanation of the Code

This code implements a simulation of a robotic arm using kinematic principles. The robotic arm consists of three segments (links) and is capable of reaching a specified position in 3D space. Below is a breakdown of the core components and their functionalities:

### Class: `robot_arm`

The `robot_arm` class encapsulates all the functionality related to the robotic arm. It includes the following key attributes and methods:

#### Attributes

- **Arm Lengths**:
  - `l1`, `l2`, `l3`: These represent the lengths of the three segments of the arm. They are critical for calculating the arm's reach and positioning.

- **Center and Radius**:
  - `center`: Coordinates of the center of an obstacle in the environment.
  - `ro`: Radius of the obstacle, used for collision detection.

- **Height and Angle Limits**:
  - `height`: The height of the obstacle.
  - `lim_min`, `lim_max`: The minimum and maximum allowable angles for each joint of the arm, which restrict the arm's movement.

#### Methods

- **Initialization**:
  - `init()`: A placeholder for any initialization needed.

- **Random Configuration Generation**:
  - `gen_rand_conf()`: Generates random angles for each joint within the defined limits, simulating possible configurations of the robotic arm.

- **Kinematics**:
  - `direct_kinematics(q)`: Calculates the (x, y, z) position of the end-effector based on joint angles `q`.
  - `inverse_kinematics(position)`: Computes the necessary joint angles to achieve a specified position in 3D space.

- **Path Planning**:
  - `get_indix_of_min_distance_point(Q_free, point)`: Finds the nearest valid configuration to a given point.
  - `find_path(X_free, start, end)`: Determines a collision-free path from the start position to the end position by searching through valid configurations.

- **Collision Detection**:
  - `collision_checker(x, circle_nb)`: Checks whether a given position is in collision with obstacles in the environment.

- **Path Refinement**:
  - `insert_points(path, n_new_points)`: Interpolates additional points between existing points in the path to create a smoother trajectory.
  - `get_path_angles(path)`: Computes the joint angles for each point along a given path.

### Visualization

The simulation includes several visualizations to illustrate the robot's movement:

1. **3D Trajectory Plot**: Displays the path the robotic arm takes in 3D space, showing the start and end points.
2. **Joint Angles Over Time**: A 2D plot that shows how the joint angles change as the robotic arm moves along the path.
3. **3D Scatter Plot of Joint Angles**: Visualizes the angles of the joints as a function of time, providing insights into the arm's motion dynamics.
4. **Animated Visualization**: An animation that illustrates the robot arm moving along the calculated path in real-time.

### Usage

To run the simulation, create an instance of the `robot_arm` class and call the `Q_X_free()` method with the desired parameters. This will initiate the path planning and visualization process.

```python
abbas = robot_arm()
abbas.Q_X_free(1)
